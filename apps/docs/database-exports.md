# Database Schema and Exports

This document provides links to the Prisma schema and exported database tables for the Learning Management System (LMS) project.

## Prisma Schema

The complete database schema is defined in the Prisma schema file:

**[ðŸ“„ Prisma Schema File](../../packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma)**

This schema includes all the models and relationships for the LMS MVP:
- User management with authentication
- Course and enrollment system
- Assignment and problem structure
- Multiple submission types (Code, Notebook, Textbox, File Upload, Video)
- Test cases and feedback system

## Database Table Exports

The following CSV files contain the exported data from each table in the database:
